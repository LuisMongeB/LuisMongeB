# Hi, I'm Luis.

I am an AI Engineer focused on **productionizing LLM applications and Agentic AI systems** and building **high-performance inference systems**.

I bridge the gap between research and production by combining the flexibility of **Python** with the performance of **Rust**.

### 🔭 Current Focus
* **Agentic Workflows:** Building autonomous systems using local LLMs (Ollama) and custom orchestration layers.
* **High-Performance AI:** Leveraging Rust to build low-latency API gateways and serving layers for AI models.

### 🏗 Architecture & Stack
* **Core:** Python (FastAPI, PyTorch), Rust (Actix, Tokio)
* **LLMs:** LangChain, Ollama, HuggingFace, OpenAI API
* **Ops:** Docker, CI/CD, Azure
